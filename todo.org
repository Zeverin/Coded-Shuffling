* TODO Clean up RandomSolver.
* DONE Integrate remaining_unicasts better in the hybrid solver.
  CLOSED: [2017-10-09 Mon 13:59]
* DONE More general hybrid solver. Hybrid solver for a more general objective function.
  CLOSED: [2017-10-09 Mon 13:59]
* TODO Add tests for the dense assignment.
Or remove it in favor of using the cached without using the cache.
* DONE binsearch should evaluate load/delay for the same realization of G

  to allow for concatenating the samples.
* DONE Perhaps parallelize the binsearch sampling.
  CLOSED: [2017-10-09 Mon 13:58]
 - Could be implemented by running a few threads that each take some samples.
 - Or by taking all samples map style.
* TODO move load_data to the simulator.
* DONE Assignment type should be an argument to the simulator.
* TODO Move all evaluators to the new format.
* DONE Add an evaluator abstract base class.
- Perhaps differentiate between evaluating parameters and assignments.
* DONE Allow for passing arbitrary parameters to evaluators.
- Maybe use a dict or kwargs.
* DONE Have the simulator save results to disk incrementally.
- Now it waits for all simulations to complete before saving to disk.
* DONE Is the order statistic code wrong?
  CLOSED: [2017-10-09 Mon 13:58]
- It iterates from 1 to q now. Should it be q+1?
* DONE LT simulator race condition
  CLOSED: [2017-10-09 Mon 13:58]
- There's a race condition when saving the results file in the LT simulator.
* TODO Clean up stats module

* TODO Deadline parameters
- Need a set of parameters where the LT code does better.
- LT codes have lower encoding/decoding complexity.
- Encoding/decoding complexity needs to be a significant part of the overall
  complexity for there to be a difference.
- Encoding complexity is proportional to r*n.
- Map complexity is proportional to r*n*N.
- Decoding complexity is proportional to N.
* TODO LT code simulations need to be rerun since they're not cached with N
